# 10 — Evidence Checklist

> **Status**: Active evidence checklist. Completed phases, Tier 1, and Tier 1.5 are populated; remaining open items are explicitly marked.
> **Owner**: Engineering + Operator
> **Last updated**: 2026-05-26
> **Parent**: [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](../../ROADMAP.md)
> **Scope**: [`00-scope-and-nonclaims.md`](00-scope-and-nonclaims.md)

## Goal

Provide a per-phase evidence checklist so that every claim in the production path has a required evidence artifact, an owner, and a signoff state.

## Current state

- Unified per-phase evidence checklist exists and is actively maintained (this doc).
- Evidence artifacts are organized in `docs/implementation-path/artifacts/` with dated filenames and cross-references.
- Pass/fail tracking exists for all completed phases; remaining open items are Phase 9 (HA) and final production-ready prerequisites.
- **Six of seven blockers unblocked/completed** as of 2026-05-21. One remains open: `BLK-A-DOM`. Tracked in [`11-blockers-and-unblock-plan.md`](./11-blockers-and-unblock-plan.md).

## Gaps

- **Resolved**: Checklist now links every phase (0–9) to evidence files with Owner, Evidence, and Status columns.
- **Resolved**: Owner assignment and signoff state tracking added to all checklist tables.
- **Remaining**: Phase 9 multi-host HA/read-replica work and final production-ready prerequisites (F.1–F.5) still require operator action and live evidence.

## Implementation tasks

- [ ] Copy relevant phase checklists into a tracking issue or project board before starting work.
- [ ] Fill in the Evidence column after executing each item.
- [ ] Request operator review and signoff when all P0 items in a phase are checked.
- [ ] Archive completed checklists with evidence artifacts.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Every phase (0–9) has a checklist table.
- [ ] Every item has an owner, evidence path, and status checkbox.
- [ ] Final production-ready claim prerequisites are listed separately.
- [ ] No item can be checked without an evidence artifact.

## Evidence required

- This checklist itself, filled and signed per phase.

## How to use this checklist

1. Before starting a phase, copy the relevant checklist items into a tracking issue or project board.
2. After executing each item, fill in the Evidence column with a file path or artifact ID.
3. When all items in a phase are checked, request operator review and signoff.
4. Do not mark a phase complete until all P0 evidence items have artifacts.

## Phase 1 — PostgreSQL production foundation

> **PG-1 scope**: PostgreSQL target/staging baseline only. Local Docker fallback evidence passed on 2026-05-18. No production-ready claim. Block A remains WAIVED/CONDITIONAL.
> **Template**: `TEMPLATE-pg-production-deployment-signoff.md` prepared for eventual production PG signoff (requires real evidence).
> **Runbook**: `PG-production-evidence-pack-runbook.md` provides concrete capture commands, redaction rules, pass/fail criteria, and rollback checks for operator execution.

## Phase 2 — SLO/SLA and workload evidence

> **Status**: SLO default-config gap **CLOSED with conservative resolution** on 2026-05-21.
> Conservative defaults (2/50) remain safety-oriented and unchanged. SLO certification requires
> explicit high-throughput profile (1000/10000). Operator must tune based on real traffic/IP
> distribution. See `docs/operations/rate-limit-tuning-guide.md`.
>
> `BLK-SLO-RAT` ratified; `BLK-SLO-TGT` unblocked on 2026-05-21. Canonical SLO certification
> attempted (2 fails, 1 pass with max-valid config). Full SLO certification NOT claimed for
> default/tuned configs. See [`11-blockers-and-unblock-plan.md`](./11-blockers-and-unblock-plan.md).

## Final production-ready claim prerequisites

> **Active blocker**: `BLK-A-DOM` — real owned domain is still required for any production-ready or full G2 closure. DuckDNS remains WAIVED/CONDITIONAL only. See [`11-blockers-and-unblock-plan.md`](./11-blockers-and-unblock-plan.md) and [`docs/implementation-path/artifacts/2026-05-21-blk-a-dom-operator-action-brief.md`](../../implementation-path/artifacts/2026-05-21-blk-a-dom-operator-action-brief.md).
> **Conditional re-signoff**: BrianNguyen authorized conditional re-signoff for single-node SQLite pilot scope on 2026-05-21. Full G2 closure remains NOT COMPLETE.
> **Tier 1 re-signoff**: BrianNguyen authorized Tier 1 domainless production-candidate acknowledgment on 2026-05-26. Full G2 closure remains NOT COMPLETE.
> **Templates prepared**: Signoff/evidence templates created 2026-05-22. See [`docs/implementation-path/artifacts/2026-05-22-no-to-yes-completion-plan.md`](../../implementation-path/artifacts/2026-05-22-no-to-yes-completion-plan.md).

| # | Item | Owner | Evidence | Status |

| F.8 | Compensate/rollback path evidence compiled | Engineering | `docs/implementation-path/artifacts/2026-05-22-compensate-path-evidence.md` | ✅ LOCAL EVIDENCE — consolidated from implementation/tests/drills; conditional only; does not complete full G2.8 |

## Non-claims

- **NOT a guarantee**: This checklist is a template. Execution and evidence creation are required to check boxes.
- **NOT production-ready**: Checking boxes in this doc does not make FerrumGate production-ready.
- **NOT self-executing**: Each item requires engineering work or operator action.
- **NOT full G2**: Conditional re-signoff on 2026-05-21 applies to single-node SQLite pilot only. Full G2 closure requires Block A resolution + operator final signoff.
- **NOT canonical SLO for all configs**: SLO PASS claimed only for max-valid rate-limit configuration (1000/10000). Default and tuned configs failed.
- **NOT production K8s/HA**: Helm live install verified on local kind cluster only.
- **NOT production HA**: HA local simulation is Docker Compose on a single host with manual promotion. No automated failover, no multi-node, no production claim.
- **NOT automated failover**: `ha-local-failover-drill` and `ha-local-ferrumd-reconnect-drill` use manual `pg_promote()` and ferrumd restart. No automatic failover mechanism exists.
