## Core control-plane endpoints (operator quick-ref)

| Lifecycle step | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `POST /v1/intents/compile` | Parse and scope intent from agent |
| `POST /v1/proposals/{proposal_id}/evaluate` | Evaluate proposal against policy bundle |
| `POST /v1/capabilities/mint` | Issue a limited-capability lease |
| `POST /v1/executions/authorize` | Gateway-level capability check before execution |
| `POST /v1/executions/{execution_id}/prepare` | Prepare rollback contract for the operation |
| `POST /v1/executions/{execution_id}/execute` | Run the tool/adapter (fs, git, sqlite, http, maildraft) |
| `POST /v1/executions/{execution_id}/verify` | Verify result against intent and policy |
| `POST /v1/executions/{execution_id}/commit` | Finalize and commit the action |
| `POST /v1/executions/{execution_id}/compensate` | Trigger compensation when a recovery path exists |
| `POST /v1/executions/{execution_id}/rollback` | Trigger rollback via prepared adapter |
| `GET /v1/executions/{execution_id}` | Inspect the stored execution record |
| `GET /v1/approvals` | List pending approvals |
| `GET /v1/approvals/{approval_id}` | Inspect a specific approval |
| `POST /v1/approvals/{approval_id}/resolve` | Approve or deny a pending approval; also available as `ferrumctl server resolve-approval` |
| `GET /v1/provenance/lineage/{execution_id}` | Inspect the execution lineage chain |
| `GET /v1/provenance/events/{event_id}` | Inspect a single provenance event, optionally with `?ancestry=true` and/or `?descendants=true` |
| `POST /v1/provenance/query` | Query provenance events by `intent_id`, `proposal_id`, `execution_id`, `capability_id`, `event_kind`, time window, or `terminal_only` |
| `POST /v1/provenance/events/external` | Ingest an externally-observed runtime event into the provenance lineage (fail-closed: execution_id and parent_event_id must exist and belong to the same execution). Also available as `ferrumctl server ingest-external-event`. |

## `ferrumctl` lineage and provenance inspection

`ferrumctl server inspect-lineage <execution_id>` supports three output formats via `--format`:

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `text` | Human-readable event list (default) |
| `json` | Full lineage as structured JSON |
| `dot` | Graphviz DOT graph; use `--output <path>` to write to file |

`ferrumctl server inspect-provenance` returns events filtered by the query parameters listed above.

HTTP adapter rollback is a **no-op by design** today; see `15-deployment-and-operations.md` for caveats.

When `ferrumd` runs with `auth.mode = "bearer"`, all non-health control-plane routes require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

## Khi nào phải cập nhật đồng thời
Nếu thay:
- field names
- object semantics
- enum values
- API payload shapes
- invariant logic

thì phải sync lại giữa:
- code
- docs
- contracts
- schemas
- openapi
